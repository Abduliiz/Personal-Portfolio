        <h2 class="heading">About <span>Me</span></h2>
        <h3>Software Engineer, Mathemation, and Community Leader</h3>
        <p>I am currently a 3<sup>rd</sup> year Mathematics student with skills in <span2>object-oriented</span2> programming such as <span2>Java</span2>, <span2>Python</span2>, and <span2>C++</span2>, I have strong knowledge
          of <span2>data structures</span2> and <span2>algorithms</span2>, and the ability to apply <span2>mathematical concepts</span2> to <span2>real-world problems</span2>.<br><br> 

          I have had a deep love for mathematics since high school, where it was a subject I excelled in. My passion naturally expanded into software development, driven by curiosity and the excitement of turning ideas into reality. With code and design, I realized I could create anything I could imagine, bringing projects to life in ways that once seemed impossible.<br><br>          

        <span id="moreText1" style = "display: none;" class="hiddentext">I have been an active member of my community since I was in elementary school. I volunteered every time my school hosted an event for our community members, and I helped run children’s soccer programs. However, I soon realized that it was important to specifically focus on underserved communities. This is why I devoted my time to helping local children, homeless people, and fellow refugees. <br><br>
          As I grew older I noticed that many children made poor choices, and due to economic pressures, many of their parents were busy working and thus unable to provide guidance. I  realized that it is important to have programs that focus on guiding children’s intellectual and spiritual development to ensure they develop qualities that they may not gain in absent homes. My friends and I created a community youth group with this goal in mind. In the group, we discussed the unique struggles faced by adolescents, how to make good choices, and planned service projects that helped them improve their community. For example, in one of our discussions, the youth noticed that there was a lot of garbage in the neighbourhood and so they planned a community clean-up and put up garbage cans. <br><br>
          After seeing the growing homelessness crisis in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside, I did some research and joined the Muslim Care Center, a non-profit organization that connects the homeless population to resources such as food, clothing, and toiletries. I have volunteered with this organization for over a year and helped organize food deliveries. I helped gather volunteers to help make and deliver food. In the winter, we also organized clothing drives. <br><br>
          Helping the youth in the community, and the homeless population allowed me to reflect on the hardships my family faced as refugees. It was significantly hard for me and my family to find resources to help us adjust and feel welcomed in Canada. In response, with a team of friends, we created WelcomeToVan.ca, a website to help newcomers in Vancouver easily find resources about learning English, finding housing, accessing healthcare services, and youth programs. We are also planning community gatherings as well to help with possible language barriers and connect refugees to create a web of support. <br><br>
          Although the pandemic put a roadblock in my regular volunteering activities, I took the time in lockdown to think of ways to adapt to my new circumstances. Many people lost their jobs and many families in my neighbourhood could not afford to purchase groceries and household necessities. I worked with one of my teachers to develop and grow a local food bank since there was an increasing strain on the city food bank. I contacted local grocery stores to get food donations, spoke with my friends, and asked for their help in unloading and packaging the food donations for easy pickup. 
          When first starting, I did not anticipate the impact my efforts would have, but through volunteering, I have learned that I can positively impact my community which in turn inspires me to do more.

          <h3>Web Development</h3>
          <p>I created my portfolio website to enhance my skills in <span2>HTML</span2>, <span2>CSS</span2> , and <span2>JavaScript</span2>.
              Previously, I worked on websites using platforms like <span2>WordPress</span2>  and <span2>Weebly</span2>, but I did not have the opportunity to use programming languages for design and development.
              Building this site has allowed me to practice and apply my learning in a hands-on way, showcasing my <span2>knowledge</span2> and <span2>experience</span2>.

          <h3>Object Oriented Programing</h3>
          <p>I have completed numerous courses that focus on object-oriented programming, specifically in <span2>Java</span2>.
             Through these courses and my personal projects, I have gained a solid understanding of fundamental concepts, including <span2>objects</span2>, <span2>classes</span2>, and <span2>methods</span2>.
              Additionally, I am well-versed in core principles such as <span2>encapsulation</span2>, <span2>abstraction</span2>, <span2>inheritance</span2>, and <span2>polymorphism</span2>.
             I have also explored advanced topics, including <span2>design patterns</span2>, as well as the use of <span2>interfaces</span2> and <span2>abstract classes</span2>.

          <h3>Game Development</h3>
          <p>Ever since I was a child, I have dreamed of creating a game. 
            My passion for this field has been long-standing, as I used to play games constantly.
             To challenge myself, I decided to create a game from scratch over a weekend, despite having no prior knowledge of game engines, content creation, or game development experience.
            In less than 48 hours, I learned how to use the <span2>Unity game engine</span2>, <span2>event scripting</span2>, <span2>procedural generation</span2>, and <span2>C#</span2>. 
            With this newfound knowledge, I successfully recreated the iconic game I first played on a mobile device: <span2>Flappy Bird</span2>.
            <span2></span2>
